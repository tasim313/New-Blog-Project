# New_Blog_Project
I learned the basics of the Django web framework by creating a simple blog application. I designed the data models and applied migrations to my project. I also created the views, templates, and URLs for my blog, including object pagination. I learned how to work with Django forms and model forms. I created a system to share my site's content by email and created a comment system for my blog. I added tagging to my blog posts, integrating a reusable application, and built complex QuerySets to retrieve objects by similarity. I learned how to create custom Django template tags and filters to provide templates with a custom functionality. I also created a sitemap for search engines to crawl my site and an RSS feed for users to subscribe to my blog. I built a search engine for my blog using the full-text search engine of PostgreSQL.
